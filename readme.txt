> Version 4.5.0 has come with a lot of features and cleaness. You may call it as a next level Accordion/FAQs block. If you update your existing block (1.x.x~4.1.0), you will find that your blocks are broken in Editor. It says **"Attempt Block Recovery"**. So, simply hit on **"Attempt Block Recovery"**. That's it, now your block is compatible with the update version.
